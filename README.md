# First_Order_Logic_Proposition_Solver

Input Format:
-  the first line contains two integer value ‘n’  the number of formulae and ‘m’ the mode
-  followed by the formulae (propositional sentences) in the next ‘n’ lines
- the last line would contain the propositional sentence that needs to be proved

Output Format:
If mode ‘m’ = 0, prints only the result (integer value 0/1)
If mode ‘m’ = 1, prints the resolution steps used first and then print the result (integer value 0/1) in the last line
